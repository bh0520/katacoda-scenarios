

* A provider is an abstract and modular approach for IaaS, SaaS and PaaS vendor integrations

* Each integration is packaged as a provider, which understands the vendorâ€™s APIs and exposes specific resources

* Example providers include docker, azurerm, aws, vmware, datadog

* Multiple providers can be referenced in the same project

* There are many [https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html](standard providers), as well as a large number of thirdparty custom providers

Providers are configured in terraform config files with a .tf extension, which typically include configuraiton of the API endpoint, credentials, debug settings, and other global parameters for a specific API integration.

This config file defines a docker provider with the host where we want to apply our configuration

<pre class="file" data-filename="provider.tf" data-target="replace">provider "docker" {
  host = "tcp://docker:2345/"
}
</pre>

Multiple providers can be referenced in the same project
